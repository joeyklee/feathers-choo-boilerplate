# Choo.js meets Feathers.js

This is a little example of putting choo.js and feathers.js together in one playground.

I hope it can serve as a boilerplate for dealing with Auth and more. I love Choo.js and Feathers.js seems too good to be true sometimes. I will try to add in different branches to show incremental development before it gets too big to read anymore.

## Branches

### 00-hello-world-setup
### 01-feathers-auth-with-message-service-and-hooks
### 02-choo-meets-feathers-as-api
### 03-authenticated-message-posting
* note, not a realtime websocket based messaging thing... yet? tbd


## Update Aug 21 2018
I haven't figured out whether or not I'm using the sockets correctly, but I just wanted to push this out there in case someone else finds it helpful. This is a sandbox I'm having fun playing in.


## Setup

In terminal window 1:
```
cd client
npm install
npm run
```

In terminal window 2:
```
cd server
npm install
npm run
```
