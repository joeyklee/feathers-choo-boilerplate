# Choo.js meets Feathers.js

This is a little example of putting choo.js and feathers.js together in one playground.

I hope it can serve as a boilerplate for dealing with Auth and more. I love Choo.js and Feathers.js seems too good to be true sometimes. I will try to add in different branches to show incremental development before it gets too big to read anymore.

## Branches

### 00-generate-choo-and-feathers
### 01-feathers-auth-with-message-service-and-hooks
### 02-choo-meets-feathers-as-api
